      <h2>welcome to Microvers two:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1783</strong> - He was born in the city of Caracas on July 24.</li>
        <li><strong>1810 - 18012</strong> - After the fall of the First Republic of Venezuela he went into exile in Cartagena, and sought help in New Granada to recover his country.</li>
        <li><strong>1813-1814</strong> - On May 14, 1813, he directed the Admirable Campaign, which began in San José de Cúcuta, in Colombia, to combat the enemy forces to arrive on August 6 of the same year to Caracas, Venezuela. His performance was admirable to such a degree that he was proclaimed as El Libertador. From that moment on, he led the destiny of his country in the Second Republic of Venezuela.</li>
        <li><strong>1819</strong> - During the Congress of Angostura, he enunciated The Angostura Discourse, one of his most outstanding writings that he produced during his life. In the document he presented a draft constitution and the following warning: the emerging national states and their institutions should respond to their own needs, without taking models from other countries[</li>
        <li><strong>1826</strong> - He convened the Congress of Panama, to organize a confederation of American nations to support each other and cooperate as partners for a common good.[6] However, they did not improve their deed, and perhaps from that situation he enunciated his phrase: ' 'I have plowed in the sea and sown in the wind'. The sentence refers to the Bolivarian dream of a great American nation, but observes how his desire would be unfulfilled due to the differences between the new nations.</li>
        <li><strong>1930</strong> - He died in Santa Marta, Colombia and his remains were transported to Venezuela in 1842, which rest today in the National Pantheon.</li>
